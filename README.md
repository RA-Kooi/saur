# Sam's AUR

This is a personal repo of packages for [Arch Linux](http://archlinux.org).  Some
of these are forks wanting a merge, modifications of modified software, or in a
couple of cases, packages I'm maintaining in AUR.

Most of these packages are for use in my radio studio for shows including
[Ask an Atheist with Sam Mulvey](https://atheist.radio), [Radio Tacoma KTAH-LP 101.9](http://radiotacoma.org), and [KTQA-LP](http://ktqa.org).


## Included Software

  * [JMPX](http://jontio.zapto.org/hda1/paradise/jmpxencoder/jmpx.html) FM encoder
  * [jack_capture](https://github.com/refutationalist/jack_capture), but with my patches my patches to set the name of the capture and set MP3 sample rate.
  * [sthttpd](https://github.com/refutationalist/sthttpd), fork of Jef Poskanzer's thttpd with my hacky php-cgi support for small systems.
  * mumble-jack-noconnect, a build of [mumble](https://wiki.mumble.info/wiki/Main_Page) with the jack patch, but the the autoconnection parts removed.
  * [darkice](http://www.darkice.org/), which is a working copy of what's in [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/darkice/) but is here for completeness.
  * php-xxhash-git an updated version of the php [extension](https://github.com/stuartherbert/php-xxhash) of [xxHash](http://cyan4973.github.io/xxHash/) 
  * [silentjack](https://www.aelius.com/njh/silentjack/) dead air detection for jack.  Not in AUR yet.
